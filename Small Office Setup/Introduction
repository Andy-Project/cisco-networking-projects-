# Small Office Network Design (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## üìå Project Overview
This project simulates the design, configuration, and testing of a fully functional small office network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It includes VLAN segmentation for different departments, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, DNS, FTP services, and wireless connectivity.

The goal was to create a realistic office network topology that follows best practices in IP addressing, subnetting, and service deployment.

- **Cisco 2960 Switch** ‚Äì Core switch with VLAN segmentation
- **WRT300N Wireless Router** ‚Äì Configured as a wireless access point (AP)
- **End Devices:**
  - 5 Desktop PCs
  - 1 Laptop
  - 1 Network Printer
  - 1 Server (DNS & FTP services)

## üóÇ VLAN & IP Structure

| VLAN ID | Department       | Subnet           | Gateway        | DHCP Range                  |
|--------:|-----------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| 10      | Sales           | 192.168.10.0/24  | 192.168.10.1  | 192.168.10.50 ‚Äì 192.168.10.254 |
| 20      | Marketing       | 192.168.20.0/24  | 192.168.20.1  | 192.168.20.50 ‚Äì 192.168.20.254 |
| 25      | Office Server   | 192.168.25.0/24  | 192.168.25.1  | 192.168.25.11 ‚Äì 192.168.25.254 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Configurations
- **VLAN Creation & Port Assignment**
  - VLAN 10: Sales Department
  - VLAN 20: Marketing Department
  - VLAN 25: Office Server
- **Inter-VLAN Routing** using subinterfaces on the router
- **DHCP Configuration** per VLAN, excluding static IP ranges
- **DNS Server** for internal name resolution (`server.local`, `printer.local`)
- **FTP Server** setup for file transfers
- **Wireless Access Point** configured with WPA2-PSK security

---

## üîç Testing & Verification
- **Ping Tests**: Verified connectivity within VLANs, between VLANs, and across wired/wireless networks
- **DNS Resolution**: Confirmed local hostname resolution
- **FTP Access**: Tested successful login and file transfer
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Fixed incorrect IP addressing on VLAN ports
  - Updated DHCP DNS server settings to use internal server
  - Resolved VLAN trunking and access mode configuration issues
